#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named aa. Print the variable.
bob = True
rodger = False 
aa = bob and rodger 
print(aa)


#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.
me = True
myself = True
b =me and myself 
print(b)


#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.
timber = True
cat = False 
c = timber and cat 
print(c)


#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
# i am going to use my last example and then just put an error in it
timber = True
cat = false 
c = timber and cat 
print(c)
